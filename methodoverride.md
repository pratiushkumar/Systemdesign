Method Overriding and @Override Annotation:
Java requires that overridden methods match the signature of the base class method exactly (name, parameters, and return type).
The @Override annotation helps developers explicitly declare their intent to override a method. The Java compiler checks that the method adheres to the signature rule, catching errors at compile time.
